## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd quick-notes-extension
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

This will start the webpack development server and watch for file changes.

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Webpack will build the extension into the `dist` directory. 

### Building for Production

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn run build
```

## Installation (Manual/Sideloading)

1.  Open Google Chrome.
2.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4.  Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5.  Select the `dist` directory from your project folder.

The Quick Notes extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome extensions list.

## Running Tests (Playwright)

To run the end-to-end and integration tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

Make sure you have built the extension (`npm run build` or `yarn build`) at least once before running tests, as Playwright will typically load the extension from the `dist` directory.
